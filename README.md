# Operating systems and concurrency example

This repository is provided to support a lecture in operating systems and concurrency. 
See the [slides](http://hesabu.net/kf5010/assets/ra/B08.pdf) for more details. It is also used
in the [lab session](http://hesabu.net/kf5010/L09.html).

Clone the repository and run the Makefile to build the program, then run it and observe the behaviour, e.g.

``` shell_session
$ git clone https://github.com/DavidKendall/bb_with_monitor
$ cd bb_with_monitor
$ make
$ ./bb
```
